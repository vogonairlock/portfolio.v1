# ZAZCDEV: <a href="https://zazcdev.github.io/webportfolio/">Web Portfolio</a>
<br>
This is a web portfolio I built for myself using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>
No frameworks used, just the plain old fundamentals. <br>
<br>  
As of [11/4/2022], this portfolio is still a work in progress. <br> 
(I currently have no projects to display apart from the portfolio itself)

## Notes on Accessibility

<br>
I've designed my portfolio to be accessible, but as I'm still learning about some <br> 
aspects of web accessibility (colour contrast especially), it is definitely a work <br>
in progress. I have included the .sr-only (screen reader only) class throughout my <br>
HTML and within my reset.css files in order to hide and display elements as appropriate <br>
for screen readers, and went through my entire website myself using a screen reader on <br>
both mobile and desktop and tailored certain elements to read appropriately. In addition, <br>
I have included reduced-animation media queries (courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/hankchizljaw/modern-css-reset">hankchizljaw</a>)'s Modern CSS Reset.
