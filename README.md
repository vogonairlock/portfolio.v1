# ZAZCDEV: Web Portfolio
This is a web portfolio I built for myself using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks used, just the plain old fundamentals. As of [11/4/2022], this portfolio is still a work in progress as I currently have no projects to display apart from the portfolio itself. 






## Notes on Accessibility
I've designed my portfolio to be accessible, but as I'm still learning about some aspects of web accessibility (colour contrast especially), it is definitely a work in progress. I have included the .sr-only (screen reader only) class throughout my HTML and within my reset.css files in order to hide and display elements as appropriate for screen reader users, and went through my entire website myself using a screen reader on both mobile and desktop and tailored certain elements to read appropriately. In addition, I have included reduced-animation media queries (courtesy of [hankchizljaw)](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/modern-css-reset).
