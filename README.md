<h1>ZAZCDEV: <a href="https://zazc.dev">Web Portfolio</a></h1><br>

This is a web portfolio I built for myself using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>
No frameworks used, just the plain old fundamentals. <br>
<br>  
<br> 

<blockquote>
  <i>As of [19/10/2022] this portfolio is in the process of a complete and total overhaul as main.css is an especially gigantic (truly) mess.</i><br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>Currently working on:</strong><br>
  <ul>
    <li>blog website for client </li>
    <li>e-commerce (React) project </li>
  </ul>

<h2>Notes on Accessibility</h2><br>

I've designed my portfolio to be accessible, but as I'm still learning about some aspects <br>
of web accessibility (colour contrast especially), it is definitely a work in progress. <br>
I have included the .sr-only (screen reader only) class throughout my HTML and within <br>
my reset.css files in order to hide and display elements as appropriate for screen readers, <br>
and went through the entire website myself using a screen reader on both mobile and <br>
desktop and tailored certain elements to read appropriately. In addition, I have included <br>
reduced-animation media queries (courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/hankchizljaw/modern-css-reset">hankchizljaw</a>'s Modern CSS Reset).
